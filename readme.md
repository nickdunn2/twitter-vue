# Twitter-like app using Laravel and Vuex

This is just an attempt to learn VueJS and Vuex by making a Twitter-like application. It has a (very basic) back-end using Laravel. Next steps will be to implement vue-router for individual tweets or individual user pages, the ability to "follow" or "subscribe to" other users, etc.

It's highly recommended that you download both the VueJS and Vuex devtools to get a feel for what is happening inside the app.
