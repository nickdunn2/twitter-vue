# Twitter-like app using Laravel and Vuex

This is just an attempt to learn VueJS and Vuex by making a Twitter-like application. It has a (very basic) back-end using Laravel. Next steps will be to implement vue-router for individual tweets or individual user pages, the ability to "follow" or "subscribe to" other users, etc.

Some helpful Vue/Vuex resources found along the way. (Will keep adding to this list.)
